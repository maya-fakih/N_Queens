# N_Queens
A simple implementation of the classic N-Queens problem. The program places N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (no shared rows, columns, or diagonals). The solver uses backtracking with efficient conflict checks and can generate a valid solution for any N ≥ 4.
